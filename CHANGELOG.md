# Changelog

## Latitude 1.2.4 (MC 1.21.1)
- EW storm intensity ramp tightened (shader-friendly haze works with Sodium + Iris) for a stronger wall near EW borders.
- Warm-band cold-biome clamp prevents snow/ice leakage in Equator/Tropics/Arid bands.
- HUD/overlay ordering preserved so warnings stay readable under the haze.
